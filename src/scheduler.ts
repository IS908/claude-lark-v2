 *
 * R1-followup asymmetry note: a legacy OLD snapshot (`created_at: ''`)
 * delete+create-replaced by a NEW job with a real timestamp returns
 * `false` here — the OLD execution WILL stomp the NEW job's runtime.
 * This is the documented trade-off: detecting "OLD lacks created_at,

   * Per-job re-entrancy guard (#77, v1.0.29; recycle-aware in v1.0.43).
   *
   * `tick()` runs on a 60s setInterval, but `executeJob()` can sit inside
   * the retry loop for up to 210s (30 + 60 + 120). Without this guard,
   * the second tick would see the same job's `next_run_at <= now`
   * (because runtime isn't persisted until the retry loop exits) and
   * fire executeJob a second time — duplicate execution, the exact
   * symptom #62 already tried to eliminate via filename-as-id.
   *
   * v1.0.43 #134 fix: switched from `Set<string>` (keyed on bare id) to
   * `Map<string, string>` (id → created_at) so the guard respects the
   * `(id, created_at)` identity tuple introduced by `isRecycledJob`.
   * Pre-fix, a `delete_job('foo')` + `create_job('foo')` during the
   * 210s in-flight window would have the NEW job's tick blocked by
   * the OLD execution's still-pending `inFlight` entry — the new job
   * would miss its first fire even though the OLD execution's
   * writeback now correctly skips. Post-fix, `tick()` skips only
   * when `inFlight.get(id) === job.meta.created_at`; a different
   * `created_at` (recycled job) is treated as a distinct logical
   * job and gets its own re-entrancy slot.
   *
   * Legacy jobs without `created_at` (very old jobs that pre-date
   * the field) use the empty string as their key value. Two legacy
   * jobs with the same id would still collide — but the PRE-#134
   * design had no way to distinguish them either; this matches the
   * pre-fix legacy behavior.
   *
   * Cleanup uses CAS-on-delete (R2-followup correction): the
   * finally-block compares the slot's current value to the
   * `created_at` captured in tick()'s closure and only deletes on
   * match. Without this, a recycle could play out as:
   *   1. tick: inFlight.set(foo, A); launch executeJob(A)
   *   2. recycle: file replaced with B
   *   3. tick: inFlight.get(foo)=A, jobA.created_at=B → release;
   *      inFlight.set(foo, B); launch executeJob(B)
   *   4. A finishes; A's finally — if id-only — runs
   *      inFlight.delete(foo), erasing B's entry; B is now
   *      unprotected and a third tick could re-launch it
   * The CAS makes step 4 a no-op for A (slot holds B, not A), so
   * B's re-entrancy stays gated until B's own finally fires.
   *
   * NOT used by recoverMissedJobs — start() awaits recoverMissedJobs
   * before installing the tick timer, so the two paths are temporally
