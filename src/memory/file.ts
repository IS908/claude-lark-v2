   * One-shot migration: scan all legacy skills (.md files without a
   * sibling .meta.json) and attribute them to the operator (OWNER).
   *
   * Rationale (#84): pre-v1.0.14 `save_skill` had no ownership tracking,
   * so any user in any chat could overwrite any other user's skill, and
   * malicious `content` would be surfaced globally by `searchSkills`.
   * v1.0.14 adds an owner gate that refuses save_skill when the slug is
   * already owned by someone else. The migration runs at startup to claim
   * legacy slugs for the OWNER (`LARK_OWNER_OPEN_ID`) so the operator
   * doesn't get locked out of their own skills the moment they upgrade.
   *
   * - Idempotent: skills with an existing sidecar are skipped.
   * - No-op without `LARK_OWNER_OPEN_ID`: legacy skills stay un-claimed
   *   and any `save_skill` on those slugs will be rejected (owner-mismatch
   *   path) until the operator either sets OWNER + restarts or deletes
   *   the offending .md manually. This is the safer failure mode — a
   *   silent migration without OWNER would risk attributing legacy
   *   content to the first caller (the precise threat we're closing).
   * - Sidecar's `created_at` reflects the .md's mtime (best-effort recovery
   *   of when the skill was actually written) and `migrated: true` so
   *   operators can tell migrated-from-legacy apart from new sidecars.
