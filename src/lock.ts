/**
 * Single-instance lock helpers (#101).
 *
 * Split out from src/index.ts so unit tests can exercise the pure
 * helpers (parseLockToken, buildLockToken, getProcessStartTime)
 * WITHOUT importing src/index.ts itself — importing index.ts triggers
 * the top-level main() invocation, which connects to Feishu and
 * starts the scheduler. That side effect would make any unit test
 * that accidentally imports from index.ts pollute the user's real
 * bot.
 *
 * The acquireLock function itself stays in index.ts because it owns
 * process-level state (the LOCK_FILE path, the signal/exception
 * handlers). It calls into the helpers here for the actual logic.

 *
 * Used to disambiguate PID reuse: macOS/Linux recycle PIDs within
 * hours; checking only `process.kill(pid, 0)` says "a process with
 * this PID exists" but cannot prove it's the SAME process that wrote
 * the lock. Comparing start time against the recorded value pins
 * identity. Uses execFileSync (NOT execSync) with argv array so pid
 * cannot inject shell metacharacters; pid is also asserted to be a
 * positive integer first.
 *
 * Synchronous: acquireLock is startup-only; small `ps` shell-out is
 * cheap and bounded. stderr is ignored so a non-existent PID doesn't
 * print "No such process" noise to operator logs.

 *   reuse fix degrades to pre-v1.0.23 behavior (single-PID match
 *   suffices to refuse) but the signal-cleanup fix still applies.
 *   On Linux/macOS `ps` is always present, so this is theoretical
 *   for the primary supported platforms.
