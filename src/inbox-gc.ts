/**
 * Inbox garbage collection (#89). The inbox directory
 * (`~/.claude/channels/lark/inbox/`) is where:
 *   - `LarkChannel.downloadImage` writes auto-downloaded images from
 *     inbound messages (channel.ts).
 *   - The `download_attachment` tool writes attachments fetched by
 *     Claude (tools.ts).
 *
 * Pre-v1.0.35 neither path called `fs.unlink` and there was no startup
 * sweep or periodic cleanup. A heavy-image deployment would silently
 * fill the disk over weeks. This module is the missing GC.
 *
 * Two complementary policies (both apply on each run):
 *   1. **Age expiry**: files whose mtime is older than `maxAgeMs`
 *      are deleted. 7 days by default — the threshold is intentionally
 *      far larger than any reasonable Claude turn so a mid-turn `Read`
 *      of `image_path` notification meta always finds its file.
 *   2. **Size cap**: if total directory size exceeds `maxSizeBytes`,
 *      oldest-first LRU eviction continues until under cap.
 *
 * The age pass runs FIRST. Files already gone via age don't contribute
 * to the size check, so an operator who configured a small age + large
 * size cap (rotate quickly, keep recent burst) gets predictable
 * behavior.
 *
 * **Mid-turn race warning (R1-followup)**: there is NO reference-counting
 * layer between the GC and in-flight Claude turns. If an operator
 * lowers `LARK_INBOX_MAX_AGE_DAYS` below the longest expected turn
 * duration (e.g. setting it to 1 day with a multi-hour research-agent
 * turn pending), the GC can unlink a file the turn is about to `Read`,
 * causing the Read to fail with ENOENT. The 7-day default makes this
 * effectively unreachable for normal operation; the env exists for
 * operators tightening disk usage, who must keep age > worst-turn-time.
 *
 * **Safety invariant**: this module assumes writers
 * (`downloadImage`, `download_attachment`) use unique filenames per
 * call (both do — `${Date.now()}-${imageKey}.png` / `${file_key}-...`).
 * Without uniqueness, a GC unlink could race a writer's open — but
 * uniqueness makes the race structurally impossible.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: `unlink` failures (file vanished concurrently,
 * permission revoked) are swallowed so one bad file doesn't abort
 * cleanup of the rest. `readdir` failure (dir missing) is a no-op —
 * nothing to collect.
 *
 * Returns a stats object for tests + operator logging.
